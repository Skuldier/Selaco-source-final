# Manual src/CMakeLists.txt Integration Instructions

If the automatic patch didn't work perfectly, manually add these lines:

## 1. Add archipelago subdirectory (after other add_subdirectory calls):

```cmake
# Add Archipelago integration
add_subdirectory(archipelago)
include_directories(archipelago)
```

## 2. Link archipelago to game executables:

Find your main game executable targets and add archipelago to their target_link_libraries:

```cmake
# For each game target, add archipelago:
target_link_libraries(doom archipelago)
target_link_libraries(heretic archipelago)  
target_link_libraries(hexen archipelago)
target_link_libraries(strife archipelago)
# or whatever your main executable is named
```

## 3. Add archipelago includes to target_include_directories:

```cmake
target_include_directories(your_target PRIVATE ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/archipelago)
```

## Verification:

After building, you should see:
- archipelago library compiled
- No linking errors about missing archipelago symbols
- Console commands available: archipelago_status, archipelago_connect, etc.
